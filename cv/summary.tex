I am a resident physician currently in my intern year before starting anesthesia residency. I am also a data scientist with experience in bioinformatics, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning who focuses on medical- and biology-related domains. My thesis work concentrated on algorithm development for microbiome data analysis, where I adapted topic model and neural network approaches for feature extraction. Other work has included genomics, transcriptomics, sequencing, mouse studies, conservation and ecology, computational neuroscience, signal processing, electronic health record analysis, time series analysis, and natural language processing.
